A free bird leaps
on the back of the wind   
and floats downstream   
till the current ends
and dips his wing
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky.

But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and   
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

This base code still needs to be put into a working program, and will not work
without further alterations in your program, as I've cut bits out.
It exists primarily to demonstrate the logic flow and to provide a template to
work from.
